# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an automated, SEO-optimized website for HoloAnima, an educational AI animation YouTube channel for children ages 3-15. The website will serve as a central hub that seamlessly integrates with the YouTube channel while providing enhanced discoverability through search engines. The core functionality centers around an automated blog system where users can upload Markdown files that are automatically converted into SEO-optimized web pages and deployed via Vercel's continuous deployment.

The website will support HoloAnima's bilingual content strategy (English and Spanish), showcase popular characters like Pip the mouse, Luna the owl, Stella the squirrel, Shelly the tortoise, Ollie the bunny, Barnaby the bear etc., and position the brand as a trusted authority in AI-animated children's educational content.
