# Stella the Squirrel
## The Kinetic Optimist with Chaos Magic

Stella is what would happen if pure joy learned to climb trees and grew a fluffy tail. She's a furry tornado of enthusiasm who somehow manages to be both the cause of and solution to half the problems in HoloAnima. Watching Stella move through the world is like watching a master class in finding delight in disaster—she's the friend who gets you covered in mud and then convinces you it's the most fun you've ever had.

Her superpower isn't just her athletic ability or her fearless climbing skills—it's her infectious capacity to reframe every setback as an adventure. When towers fall, Stella celebrates the splash. When she accidentally destroys someone's sandcastle, she doesn't just apologize; she becomes part of the healing by learning the art of simply being present. She approaches every group project with the confidence of someone who has never met a problem she couldn't scramble over, under, or through.

Stella lives in a world where "falling down is the best part," and somehow, through the sheer force of her irrepressible spirit, she makes everyone else believe it too. She's the friend who turns your worst day into your favorite memory, usually without even trying.
