# Ollie the Bunny
## The Golden-hearted Speedster

Ollie bounces through life with the enthusiasm of someone who believes the world is fundamentally good and every day holds the possibility of a new adventure. His ears bob with each hop, and his genuine excitement about everything from building sandcastles to solving puddle problems makes every group activity feel like the most important mission in the world.

What makes Ollie truly special isn't his impressive speed or his useful knot-tying abilitiesâ€”it's his fundamental honesty and the courage it takes to live that way. When he accidentally cracks the Friendship Rock, Ollie's first instinct might be to hide the damage, but his true nature won't let him carry that secret's weight. His journey from fear to truth-telling is a masterclass in the kind of bravery that builds real friendships.

Ollie's enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of his judgment, leading to spectacular splashes in puddles and occasional collisions with precious objects. But his friends have learned that Ollie's mishaps often lead to the group's most important lessons about forgiveness, honesty, and the beautiful imperfection that makes life interesting. He's the friend whose genuine heart makes you want to be a better version of yourself.
